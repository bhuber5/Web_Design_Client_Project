            <div class="pax_info">PAX is a massive convention in Boston, MA for all things games. Demo the newest stuff (digital and tabletop) in the Expo, attend panels on design and narrative, or network with reps from companies like Blizzard, Nintendo, and NVIDIA. The DGA organizes a yearly trip for this event, coordinating transportation and lodging for anyone interested.</div>  

            <h1 class = "title">How to Attend:</h1>
            
            <div class="pax_info">Boston is a tiny place, and the convention is in huge demand. As a result, the tickets can be extremely hard to get. The Saturday badge sold out in about 1 hour last year. They will go on sale at a random time, typically late Oct/early Nov. Because of this, the DGA cannot get your badge for you. Stalk their website, follow them on twitter! Depending on available funds, we may reimburse badges for all members as well.</div>
            

            <h1 class = "title">When is it?</h1>
            <div class="pax_info">The convention takes place Friday-Sunday sometime in the spring. We typically leave on Thursday afternoon and arrive at the hotel that evening. Sunday is a half day at PAX, so we usually leave in the morning or afternoon on Sunday.</div>
